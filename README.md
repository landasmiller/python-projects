# 🐍 Elandas Miller’s Python Projects Journey

Welcome to my personal Python portfolio — a growing collection of projects that mark my evolution as a programmer, problem solver, and builder. Whether it's automating everyday tasks, exploring data, or integrating AI tools, this repo is where experimentation meets ambition.

## 🚀 Why This Repository Exists

As an MBA student passionate about technology, I’m building the skills to **bridge business intuition with technical execution**. This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Python — starting from foundational scripting to more advanced applications in AI, automation, and data analysis.
